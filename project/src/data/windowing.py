"""
Sliding-window utilities shared across Isolation Forest, LSTM, and Autoencoder.

Two windowing strategies are provided:
- create_windows: flattens raw values in each window (high-dimensional,
  rarely used directly for IF since it scales poorly with window_size * n_features)
- create_windows_stats: extracts summary statistics per window (mean/std/min/max/delta),
  which is what the Isolation Forest baseline actually uses

Also includes conversion helpers between window-level predictions/labels
and point-level (per-timestep) predictions/labels, since ground truth
anomaly_sequences are given as point-level ranges.
