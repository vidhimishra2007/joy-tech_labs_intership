# timesteps) found during EDA. STRIDE=10 keeps runtime reasonable across
# 82 channels while still giving decent temporal resolution.

# ---- Evaluation ----
# NOTE: contamination is currently derived from imbalance_df, which uses
# TRUE test-set anomaly fractions. This is a form of label leakage into a
# hyperparameter and should be flagged as a known limitation, or replaced
# with IF_DEFAULT_CONTAMINATION for a leakage-free baseline comparison.
